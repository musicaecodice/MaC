    "Every parameter of sound (pitch, spectrum, intensity, envelope, duration, etc.) was governed by rigid numerical rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The electroacoustic instruments available in the Cologne studio (oscillators, filters and ring modulators) and the possibility of recording the resulting sound on magnetic tape were the ideal tools for developing these ideas.\n",
