    "The first musical works recorded on media were created in the 1950s in the Radio France studios in Paris by composers belonging to the Groupe de recherches musicales (GRM) by Pierre Schaeffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Composers such as Pierre Henry, François Bayle, Bernard Parmegiani, Christian Zanési and Daniel Teruggi have collaborated with this institute.\n",

    "These composers, more or less, referred to Schaeffer’s sound theories about \"musique concrete\" later outlined in his book  “Traité des Objects Musicaux”.\n",
    "\n",
    "The design of the studio followed strict Schaefferian theory and was completely centered around tape manipulation, recording and editing.\n",

    "Two main electroacoustic instruments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Phonogène $\\rightarrow$ a multi-headed tape instrument in three versions:\n",
    "  - Chromatic phonogène. Tape loop at varied speeds. It produced short bursts of tape sounds at varying pitches defined by a small one-octave keyboard.\n",
    "  - Sliding phonogène. It produced continuous tone by varying the tape speed via a control rod.\n",
    "  - Phonogène Universal. It allowed time stretching without transposing the pitches and vice versa obtained through a rotating magnetic head.\n",
    "* Morphophone $\\rightarrow$ a type of tape loop-delay mechanism. The sound was picked up at varying points on the tape by ten magnetic heads (one recording, one erasing and ten playback heads) then passed through ten bandpass fileters (one for each head).\n",

    "* if the melody is in G major and we play an F natural we perceive a discordant note.\n",
    "  - the musical scale is a structure that influences the encoding and decoding of the notes (objects).\n",

    "Structure provides the relevant features that enable members of a musical tradition to encode and decode sounds.\n",

    "In music, these structures are usually organized according to coherent variations of characterizing patterns (major, minor, etc.).\n",

    "## The poietic dimension: determinism <a name=\"comprocess\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter we saw that the musicologist J.J.Nattiez defines the poietic dimension as the set of strategies activated by the author that lead to the creation of the work (something that did not exist before).\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the simple organization of sounds over time, stripped of all other components that contribute to their creation, the processes we can employ in design and implementation are essentially two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* deterministic procedures\n",
    "* stochastic procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "We will deal with the first type in this paragraph while the second in the chapter on computer music.\n",
    "\n",
    "In philosophical and scientific language, determinism is a conception according to which the events of metaphysical, physical, or moral reality are necessarily and invariably connected to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we make this choice when composing a piece, we face two options:\n",
    "\n",
    "* use our 'libero arbitrio' and choose all the parameters at our own discretion (not randomly, but according to a specific intention).\n",
    "* follow or create systems of rules to generate or transform some or all of the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Libero arbitrio\n",
    "\n",
    "This procedure may seem the simplest.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality it is the most complex because it cannot be formalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its success depends exclusively on the composer's determination and experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "It requires a high level of consciousness.\n",
    "\n",
    "It presupposes a full awareness of oneself and the external world with which we interact, our identity and the complexities of our internal activities. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is because the conveyance of the musical idea cannot by definition be governed by rules shared by:\n",
    "* composer \n",
    "* performer\n",
    "* listener.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we choose this procedure we must be careful to avoid any mnemonic reference to any musical systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is a-thematic and a-motivic in the form of an infinite ever-changing continuous line. \n",
    "\n",
    "Without developments, perceptible variations, or repetitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is perhaps the procedure closest to pure unmediated expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can consider it the ultimate point of arrival in the historical development of a musical civilization, absolute freedom understood not as a void but as a container of all possible rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rules and theories\n",
    "\n",
    "The second option is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* choose a system of rules from a past or present musical tradition.\n",
    "* define our own system of rules that can be valid only for a single piece or a distinctive feature of our poetics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference is that in the first case the codes of meaning are shared within a reference culture while in the second they are not, or not yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike in the past, today we can choose the system that best conveys our musical thinking because never before have our ears and senses been bombarded as continuously by every type of sound and language from the most disparate media as we are in our daily lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea is masterfully expressed in the appendix to some editions of I. Calvino's American Lessons, entitled \"Beginning and Ending.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"[...]</br>\n",
    "Start writing a novel. \n",
    "\n",
    "And this is the moment of choice: we are offered the possibility of saying everything, in every possible way; and we must arrive at saying one thing, in a particular way. \n",
    "\n",
    "The starting point [...] will therefore be this decisive moment for the writer: the detachment from the unlimited and multifaceted potentiality to encounter something that does not yet exist but that can exist only by accepting limits and rules. \n",
    "\n",
    "Up until the moment before we begin to write, we have the world at our disposal, a sum of information, experiences, values – the world given as a whole, without a before or an after, the world as individual memory and as implicit potentiality; and we want to extract from this world a discourse, a story, a feeling: or perhaps more precisely we want to perform an operation that allows us to situate ourselves in this world. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have all the languages at our disposal: those developed by literature, the styles in which civilizations and individuals have expressed themselves over the centuries and countries, and also the languages developed by the most varied disciplines, aimed at achieving the most varied forms of knowledge: and we want extract from it the language suitable for saying what we want to say, the language that is what we want to say.\n",
